# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

## Overview
This document provides a brief overview of the OctoAcme project management processes, summarizing key workflows, roles, communication strategies, and quality assurance practices.

## Project Lifecycle

### Project Initiation
Projects begin with initiation, which includes:
- **Validating business needs**: Confirm the business need and define measurable outcomes
- **Identifying stakeholders**: Identify stakeholders and champions, create a stakeholder list with communication plan
- **Setting success criteria**: Define clear success metrics and SMART objectives
- **Project One-pager**: Create a lightweight document covering problem statement, goals, success metrics, timeline, and resource needs
- **Decision gate**: Move to planning when success metrics are clear, stakeholders agree on priority, and team availability is confirmed

### Project Planning
Planning involves:
- **Breaking work into increments**: Create prioritized backlog with shippable increments and acceptance criteria
- **Aligning responsibilities**: Define team roles, estimate scope, and assign ownership
- **Managing risks and milestones**: Identify dependencies, create release plan with milestone map, maintain risk register
- **Definition of Done**: Document clear DoD for all work items
- **Sprint/Iteration planning**: Pull items that meet DoD with clear acceptance criteria, respecting team capacity

## Core Roles and Responsibilities

### Project Managers (PM)
- Coordinate delivery activities, schedules, and communications
- Create and maintain project plans and timelines
- Manage risks, dependencies, and resource constraints
- Facilitate meetings (kickoff, planning, retrospectives)
- Ensure consistent project documentation and status reporting

### Product Managers (PdM)
- Define problem statements and success metrics
- Own product vision and prioritize the roadmap and backlog
- Collaborate with stakeholders and engineering on trade-offs
- Validate solutions through user research and metrics

### Developers
- Design, build, test, and deliver software components
- Implement features to meet acceptance criteria
- Write and maintain tests and documentation
- Participate in design and code reviews
- Assist in estimating and planning work

### QA/Testing
- Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- Perform manual QA for feature acceptance when needed
- Ensure test coverage and quality standards are met

## Communication Strategies

### Regular Cadences
- **Weekly PM/PdM syncs**: Alignment meetings between Project Manager and Product Manager
- **Daily standups**: 15-minute team standups (or twice weekly, as agreed) focusing on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Regular stakeholder briefings and roadmap updates
- **Weekly delivery sync**: Show progress, updates, and flagged risks

### Communication Templates
- **Weekly Status**: Progress this week, next steps, risks & blockers, decisions needed
- **Demos/Reviews**: End of each sprint or milestone
- **Escalations**: Ad-hoc escalations as needed through defined escalation paths

## Work Tracking and Execution

### Project Boards
- Use project boards (e.g., GitHub Projects) with columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done
- Track velocity and burndown
- Monitor success metrics identified in the Project One-pager

### Pull Request Workflow
- Small PRs (<= 400 lines when possible)
- Include issue link and acceptance criteria in PR description
- Run automated tests and linting in CI before requesting review
- Require at least one approval before merging

### Regular Demos
- Schedule regular demos at the end of each sprint or milestone
- Show progress to stakeholders and gather feedback

## Quality Assurance Practices

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for new logic
- Integration tests where applicable
- End-to-end smoke tests for critical flows before release
- Security scanning in CI

### Manual Testing
- Manual QA for feature acceptance when needed
- Pre-release smoke tests on staging environment

### CI Pipelines
- Automated tests and linting run in CI before PR approval
- Passing CI and security scans required before release
- Continuous monitoring of key signals (errors, latency, usage)

### Deployment Checklists
- All acceptance criteria met and PRs merged
- Passing CI and security scans
- Release notes drafted
- Rollback/mitigation plan documented
- Deploy to staging and run smoke tests
- Deploy to production (automated pipeline preferred)
- Run post-deploy verifications
- Announce release to stakeholders and support

## Risk Management

### Risk Register
Maintain a risk register with:
- ID, Description, Impact (High/Med/Low), Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner, Mitigation plan, Status
- Review at weekly syncs and update status

### Escalation Paths
- **Level 1**: Team-level triage in daily standup
- **Level 2**: PM escalates to Product Lead and dependent teams
- **Level 3**: Sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues
- For security incidents, follow security incident runbook and notify Security on-call

### Weekly Risk Review
- Review risk register at weekly syncs
- Update risk status and mitigation plans
- Escalate high-impact risks as needed

## Retrospectives and Continuous Improvement

### When to Conduct Retrospectives
- After each sprint, release, or important milestone
- After incidents (blameless post-incident retrospectives)

### Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items with owner and due date
- Follow-up on previous action items

### Continuous Improvement
- Prioritize 2-3 top action items to avoid overload
- Add action items to the project backlog with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in weekly PM sync
- Measure impact of action items and celebrate improvements

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, maintain:
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Principles

All OctoAcme projects follow these principles:
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named PM and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning
